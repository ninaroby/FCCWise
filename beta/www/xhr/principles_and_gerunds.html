<h1>Present Participle and Gerund Phrases</h1>
<h3>I. Learn</h3>
<p>Most present participle and all gerund phrases begin with an –ing word. This can cause
some confusion if a tutee asks you if walking, eating, etc. are verbs. The function of present
particles and gerunds is what sets them apart.</p>
<p>Present Participle Phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li> Act as adjectives
<li> Usually include objects and or modifiers that complete the thought.
<br>Example Sentence: The horse <b>trotting up to the fence</b> hopes that you have some food.
 Gerund Phrases:
<li> Act as the noun</li>
<br><p><b>Walking on the beach</b> is dangerous if there are thousands of jellyfish.</p>
<br><p>What’s the verb? <b>Walking on the beach</b> is the subject of the verb is.</p>
<br><b><i>II. Identify</i></b> - Directions: Identify present participle phrases with (P) and gerund phrases with
<br>(G). Then underline the identified phrase.
<br>____ 1. Eating on the porch is fun if the weather is nice.
<br>____ 2. Walking on the beach, Susan had to walk around hundreds of jellyfish.
<br>____ 3. Rising out of the sea in front of us, the sun started to warm our faces.
<br>____ 4. Traveling might satisfy your need for a new experience
<br>____ 5. Sarah loves her cowboy boots, wearing them even to bed.
<br>____ 6. The girl wearing the chicken costume is my sister.
