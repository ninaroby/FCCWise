<h1>Why Summarize, Paraphrase, or Quote?</h1>

<p>"A <i>summary</i> is a relatively brief, objective account, in your own words, of the main ideas in a source
passage." p. 579, Rosen and Behrens</p>

<p>"A <i>paraphrase</i> is a restatement, in your own words, of a passage of text. Its structure reflects the
structure of the source passage. Paraphrases are sometimes the same length as the source passage,
sometimes shorter. In certain cases--particularly if the source passage is written in densely
constructed or jargon-laden prose--the paraphrase may be even longer than the original. ... Keep in
mind that only an occasional word (but not whole phrases) from the original source appears in the
paraphrase, and that a paraphrase's sentence structure does not reflect that of the source." p. 580,
Rosen and Behrens</p>

A <i>quotation</i> uses the exact words of the original.

<h3>Summarize</h3>

	<ul>
	<li> To condense a long, detailed passage

<h3>Paraphrase</h3>

	<li> To retain the ideas in the original passage but put them in your own words, often because you
	want them to be clearer to your readers

<h3>Quote</h3>

	<li> To maintain a passage which is particularly well-written.
	<li> To present to the reader a passage which will be discussed in some detail
	<li> To set forth the exact wording (e.g., of a definition, law, etc.)

<h3>General Reasons</h3>

	<li> To bolster your point with the credibility or reputation of the source
	<li> To identify others' opinions, theories, and personal explanations
	<li> To present assertions of fact that are open to dispute
	<li> To present statistics
	<li> To establish your ethos or character, especially as a good, reliable scholar/researcher
	<li> To acknowledge help provided by friends, instructors, or others
	<li> To impress people with who you have read (e.g., to show what camp you are in, that you have
			read literature from the other camps, that you have been thorough in your research, or that you
			have read the classic works in the area)
	<li> To let the reader know where the document can be found</ul>

<h3>What Not to Quote</h3>

<p>Do NOT quote facts available in a wide variety of sources, your own independent ideas, or primary
research.</p>

<h3>Common Knowledge</h3>

<p>Telling people who have written few research papers that "common knowledge" need not be cited is
not particularly useful unless explained in some detail. First, common knowledge to whom?
Obviously, you must know the audience. Is it readers like yourself, the average adult with a college or
university education, someone working in the discipline, or someone whose area of expertise is
precisely your topic?</p>

<p>Common knowledge can be facts or interpretations. Oddly, commonly known facts do not have to be
known exactly. For example, the typical adult with a university degree would probably know that
George Bernard Shaw was an English playwright who lived around the turn of the century. You
would not have to acknowledge a source for Shaw's birth and death dates: your readers would see the
dates and think, "Yes, that looks right." The other reason you would not have to acknowledge a source
here is that the information is readily available in all sorts of reference books.</p>

<p>It is difficult for someone new to an academic topic to discover what is common knowledge, for not
only must everyone in the discussion know the fact or opinion, but they must know that everyone
knows.</p>

<p>Ideas have a long and complicated history--to the point where some people question the possibility of
having an idea that is uniquely, originally your own. If your readers are likely to question where you
got the idea from, cite the source. Don't let the reader even suspect you of plagiarizing.</p>

<p>If in doubt, cite</p>
.
<p>If in further doubt, you can also ask your instructor.</p>
