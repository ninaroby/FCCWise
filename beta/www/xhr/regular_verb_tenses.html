	<h1>Regular Verb Tenses</h1>
<h2>I. Eight Basic Tenses</h2>
<p><h3>Directions:</h3> Look at the table below. Create your own sentences once you have studied the chart
below. You can try a new tense that you just learned or one that you want to practice.</p>
<p>The table below reviews the verb forms for all seven basic tenses used with I, you, we, they
(third-person plural), and she (third-person singular). The table also reviews the general meaning
of each tense.</p>

<h2>II. Tenses</h2>
<p>For regular verbs, there is a pattern for forming verbs based on tenses (or time). There are seven
basic verb tenses:</p>

	<ol>
	<li>Simple Present: They talk</li>
	<li>Present Perfect: They have talked</li>
	<li>Present Progressive: They are talking</li>
	<li>Simple Past: They talked</li>
	<li>Past Perfect: They had talked</li>
	<li>Future: They will talk</li>
	<li>Future Perfect: They will have talked</li>
	</ol>

<p>The examples above work with the subject they. They is a third-person plural noun. What do
these verbs look like when paired with a third-person singular noun? See below.</p>

	<ol>
	<li>Simple Present: She talks</li>
	<li>Present Perfect: She has talked</li>
	<li>Present Progressive: She is talking</li>
	<li>Simple Past: She talked</li>
	<li>Past Perfect: She had talked</li>
	<li>Future: She will talk</li>
	<li>Future Perfect: She will have talked</li>
	</ol>

<p>Note that only two major elements differ between the third-person plural and third-person
singular nouns: the simple present and the helping verbs (has, is, had, will, will have) in the
Present Perfect, Present Progressive, Past Perfect, and Future Perfect tenses.</p>
