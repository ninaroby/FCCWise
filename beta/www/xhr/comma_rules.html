<h2>Comma Rules </h2>

<p><h3>1. Use a comma before a coordinating conjunction</h3> (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so, sometimes 
referred to as FANBOYS) <h3>that separates two independent clauses.</h3> Basically, the comma and 
FANBOYS join together two complete ideas or sentences. 
</p>
	<blockquote><b>Example:</b> I like to read, and I also enjoy writing. </blockquote>

<p><h3>2. Use a comma after an introductory word, phrase, or clause that comes before a main 
 clause.</h3> Remember, dependent clauses begin with dependent marker words such as when, as, for, 
because, and others. This helps you remember where to place your comma. </p>

	<blockquote><b>Word:</b> <i>Finally,</i> I was able to relax.</blockquote> 

	<blockquote><b>Phrase:</b> <i>Working in groups</i>, the students completed the assignment. </blockquote>

	<blockquote><b>(Dependent) 
	 			Clause: </b>	Since the new system has been implemented, payroll has been processed 
	 				25 percent faster than it had been using the prior system.</blockquote> 
 
<p><h3>3. Use commas around words, phrases, and clauses in the middle of a sentence when they 
  aren’t essential to the meaning of the sentence.</h3> Notice, the comma is placed on the inside of 
 the quotation mark.</p> 

	<blockquote><b>Word:</b> By “imagination,” then, I mean the free intellectual and sensory play of 
	 	the mind. </blockquote>

	<blockquote><b>Phrase:</b> Karl Marx, an important nineteenth-century sociologist, believed in his 
		role as a social thinker to change the world. </blockquote>

	<blockquote><b>(Removable) 
			 		Clause:</b>	 	Senator McGilvery, who is a Democrat from Rhode Island, dealt fully and 
					responsibly with the controversy his new child care bill sparked. </blockquote>
 
<p><b>*Remember:</b> Phrases do NOT have both a subject and a verb, whereas clauses DO have both a subject and a verb. If 
 you need more help with understanding clauses vs. phrases, please see handout “Grammar Terms.”</p> 


<h4>4. Use commas between items in a series.</h4>

	<blockquote><b>Words:</b> I made the salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and balsamic 
	 	vinaigrette.</blockquote> 

	<blockquote><b>Phrases:</b> The three reasons for closing were insufficient enrollment, poor 
		instructional materials, and inadequate funds. </blockquote>

	<blockquote><b>Clauses:</b> If the procedure is carefully planned, if that plan is followed with skill, 
		and if the results are carefully analyzed, we might receive the research 
		award. </blockquote>

<h4>5. Use a comma to separate two or more coordinate adjectives describing the same noun.</h4> 

	<blockquote><b>Example:</b> The generous, friendly man was popular in the community.</blockquote> 

<h4>6. Use commas before and after a quotation within a sentence.</h4> 

	<blockquote><b>Example:</b> A wise man once said, “Don’t believe everything you read on the 
		Internet.” </blockquote>

	<blockquote><b>Example:</b> “Tomorrow is our anniversary,” she reminded him. “Don’t forget!” </blockquote>

<h4>7. Use a comma before an afterthought or a thought that contrasts or differs from the main 
idea of the sentence. </h4>

	<blockquote><b>Afterthought:</b> 	For Canada, the War of 1812 was vitally important, far more important 
						than it was for Britain. </blockquote>
<blockquote><b>	Contrasting/ 
 			Differing 
 			Thought: </b>		He was late for his appointment, not early.</blockquote> 
 
<h4>8. Use commas to set off professional titles, items in dates, and geographical names</h4>.

<blockquote>	<b>Professional 
			Titles: </b>	Nicole Smith, Ph.D., will be speaking at the banquet tonight. </blockquote>

	<blockquote><b>Items in 
		 			Dates:</b> 		Nicole Smith was born on August 4, 1985, in Fresno, California. </blockquote>

<blockquote>	<b>Geographical 
				Names: </b>		I was born in Fresno, California, on August 18, 1994. </blockquote>
