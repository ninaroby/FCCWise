<h1>Prepositions and Prepositional Phrases</h1>
<h3>I.Prepositions</h3>
<p>A preposition is a single word. Prepositions generally express a spatial, temporal, or other
relationship. There are about 150 prepositions in the English Language.</p>
<h2>Commonly Used Prepositions</h2>
<!--Insert three column table, i'm unsure about this-->

<h3>II. Prepositional Phrases</h3>
<p>A prepositional phrase is a group of words (usually 3 to 5 words) that begins with a preposition.</p>

Examples:

	<ul>
	<li> in a yellow house</li>
	<li> over the large hill</li>
	<li> at the small pond</li>
	</ul>

<p>A prepositional phrase must always contain a preposition, but it may also contain one or more of
the following:</p>

	<ul>
	<li> article (a, an, the)</li>
	<li> noun (some examples are house, hill, pond)</li>
	<li> pronoun (some examples are him, her, them)</li>
	<li> adjective (some examples are yellow, large, pretty)</li>
	<p>A prepositional phrase can never contain any one of the following elements:</p>
	<li> Subject Tim dropped the aquarium on the floor.</li>
	<li> Verb Tim dropped the aquarium on the floor.</li>
	<li> Object Tim dropped the aquarium on the floor.</li>
	</ul>

<p>Note: Many prepositional phrases will contain an object TO THE PREPOSITION, but not an
object of the main clause of the sentence.</p>
<h3>III. Grammar Tip</h3>
<p>If you are looking for the subject and/or verb of a main clause in a sentence, cross off the
prepositional phrase(s) since neither the subject nor the verb will be contained in a prepositional
phrase. This will help you to identify the core parts (subject and verb) of the sentence more
easily. When you edit your own writing, mentally crossing off the prepositional phrases will help
you to identify whether you have included a subject and a verb; then you will know you have
written a complete sentence and not a fragment.</p>

<h3>IV. Your Turn</h3>
<p>Underline the prepositional phrase(s)</p>

	<li> I ran behind the grocery store yesterday.</li>

	<li> I dropped my flash drive under the chair while I was getting tutored.</li>
	<li> My brother and sister drove to the top of the</li>
