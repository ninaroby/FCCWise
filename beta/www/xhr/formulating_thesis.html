<h1>Formulating a Good Thesis</h1>

<h2>What is a thesis? A thesis is a sentence asserting the main point of your essay. </h2>
 
<h2>Know the difference between a topic and a thesis. </h2>

 	Examples: <!--Tried indenting  "Examples:", needs to be corrected-->

 		<blockquote><u>Topic:</u> My night in jail. 
 		 		<u>Thesis:</u> After my night in jail, I will have more respect for prisoner’s rights.</blockquote>
 
		<blockquote><u>Topic:</u> Phone tapping is an issue of civil liberties. <br>
				<u>Thesis:</u> When government officials place innocent citizens under observation and 
				routinely tap one another’s phones, everyone’s civil liberties are 
				threatened. <br>
				<u>Thesis:</u> Despite its infringement of civil liberties, phone tapping is the most 
				effective device the government has for procuring evidence in criminal 
				cases. </blockquote>
 
<h2>Limit the scope of your thesis. </h2>
 
 	<blockquote><u>Thesis too broad:</u> 	Garage sales reflect the times we live in. <br>
 			<u>Thesis improved:</u> 	Garage sales circulate goods during periods of high 
 								inflation and high unemployment. (“The times” are 
 								carefully defined.) </blockquote>
 
			<blockquote><u>Thesis too broad:</u> 	Late marriages are creating a different kind of American 
											family life. <br>
						<u>Thesis improved:</u> 	Because marriage is often postponed to accommodate 
											careers, Americans are creating a new kind of family in 
											which parents are old enough to be their children’s 
											grandparents. (Reason for late marriage and a detailed 
											explanation of “different” belong in the thesis.) </blockquote>
 
<h2>Three things characterize a good thesis.</h2> 
<ol>
<li> It should be so clear that it leaves no doubt in your mind, or in your reader’s, about what 
you are going to discuss in your essay. 
<li> It should take a stand based on your informed opinion. 
<li> It should be specific enough to give your essay a good, strong push in the direction you 
want to go. 
</ol>
 
<br>Examples: 
<ul>
<li> Despite predictions to the contrary from parents and church groups, coeducational college 
dormitories have not proved to be hotbeds of promiscuity. 
<li> Although nuclear, solar, and fusion power are promising energy sources, each also has 
serious disadvantages. 
<li> In “A Hanging,” George Orwell shows that capital punishment is not only immoral, but 
innatural. 
<li> Though the president has repeatedly promised to control unemployment, his three major 
programs to date have failed to solve the problem. *Adapted from The Random House Handbook by Frederick Crews and Patterns for College Writing by 
Kirszner and Mandell.

<li> Contrary to popular assumptions, myths are more than fairy stories; they are tales that 
express the underlying attitudes a society has toward important issues. 
 </ul>

<h2>How to write a thesis statement:</h2> 
<ol>
<li> Start with an assertion. 
Fresno is a great place to live 
<li> Ask why, then answer with a because clause. 
because of its location, climate, and cultural. 
<li> If your thesis is controversial, begin the thesis with the objection in an although, despite, 
contrary to clause. 
Contrary to Rand McNally’s opinion, Fresno is a great place to live because of its 
location, climate, and cultural diversity. 
</ol>

<h3>Here are some more examples.</h3> 
<ul>
<li> Although some students find their freshman year exciting and rewarding, many 
others find it depressing, because they have moved away from their parents’ 
homes for the first time, because it is painful to be separated from established 
friends, and because homework and grading are usually more demanding than 
they were in high school. 
<li> Although men and women in college should certainly have equal opportunities to 
participate in sports, the government should not insist on equal expenditures for 
men’s and women’s athletic programs, because in colleges where a football 
program exists it requires disproportionately high expenditures, and because such 
a program can produce income to support the entire spectrum of men’s and 
women’s athletics.
</ul> 

 <br>
<p>A mouthful? Sound boring? Yes. But don’t worry: it will not appear anywhere in 
 the body of your essay. It is just a roadmap to help you organize your essay to 
 make sure that you are in control of your material.</p>
