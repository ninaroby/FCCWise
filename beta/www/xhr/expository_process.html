<h1>Expository/Process Essay</h1>

<section><h3>Before writing:</h3>
<br>An expository/process essay is an essay on how to do something or how something is done. It is
an instructional essay meant to inform the reader. Examples of topics are “How to make a
smoothie” or “How to replant a tree.” You want to find a topic that you can explain in multiple
steps.</section>
<br>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<section>Here, you introduce your topic. A good way to start is to hook your reader with a
general statement and give more and more specific details until you get to the most
specific sentence of your introduction: your thesis statement. Refer to the
Introductions handout.</section>
<br>
<h3>Thesis:</h3> <section>Like any essay, you will still need a thesis statement. Here, however, you are
going to tell us the topic of which you will be giving instructions.</section>
<blockquote>Ex: <i>Learning how to replant a tree can be done in three easy steps: uprooting,
moving, and replanting.</i></blockquote>
<h3>Body:</h3>
<section>Now you will begin to tell us what to do! As hard as it may be, avoid using “you” in
your paper. Pretend you are writing a manual. This will help avoid this issue. Use
direct statements to tell the reader how to do whatever it is you want us to learn how
to do. You must be objective and not use your own bias. Avoiding “I” statements will
help accomplish this.</section>
<blockquote>Bad Ex. “You then will put the hat on your head.”
<br>Good Ex. “Then, put the hat on one’s head.”</blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<section>Here you can sum up what you talked about by restating the main steps of the
process. Restate your thesis in a different way and then you’re done!</section>

<br>Examples of topics you can explain are on the back!</br>
