                    <h4>Should I take the Algebra Readiness (AR) Test?</h4>

                    <p>You should take the Algebra Readiness Test if any of the following apply:</p>
                    <ul class="content">
                    <li>You had no high school algebra.</li>
                    <li>You had one year of high school algebra or the equivalent.</li>
                    <li>It has been several years since your last math course.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>You should consider taking the Elementary Algebra Test if:</p>
                    <ul class="content">
                    <li>You had two or more years of high school algebra or the equivalent and</li>
                    <li>you received a 'C' or better in your last math course and
                    you completed your last math course in the last two years.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Skills Assessed are:</h4>
                    <ul class="content">
                    <li>Integers, Fractions, Decimals, Percent & Proportion</li>

                    <p class="last">Although the topics may be scattered throughout the exam, you must pass each topic before you would be placed into the next course. Your goal may not be to get an 'A', but to review topics you have already learned through sample tests and other materials to be appropriately  placed.
