                    <p>The PASS program is positively changing; here is an update! If you do not know, my name is Jennifer Dorian, and I coordinate PASS, which stands for Peer Assisted Study Sessions and is a programmatic branch of the WRC, which is coordinated by Tabitha Villalba. PASS creates equity on the FCC campus in a holistic manner that reflects the benefits of tutoring and supplemental instruction through a hybrid/adaptation. These benefits are touted in the literature and include academic and peer support to improve student learning outcomes and affective products including psycho-social benefits as well as cultural and collective awareness (Arco-Tirado et al., 2011; Arendale, 2010; ASHE, 2010; Austin, 2006; DeFeo & Caparas, 2014; Dlouha et al., 2013; CCCSE, 2012; Henry et al., 2011; Munley et al., 2010; Nora & Crisp, 2008; Sorrentino, 2007; White et al., 2011). As PASS grows, it becomes increasingly important to share our problems, solutions, growth, needs, and practices. PASS uses a supplemental instruction-tutoring hybrid adaptation unlike any other. It is increasingly important to educate our campus about PASS as we change and grow so rapidly. PASS differs from ETC, TC, and the WRC. While PASS is a programmatic branch of the WRC, it is a supplemental instruction tutoring hybrid adaptation that embeds a tutor in the classroom with students. The tutor holds special study sessions in the PASS Center at scheduled times; however, the PASS Center is open to all PASS students during all open hours. In addition, we now offer 24/7 live online tutoring. We find this type of flexibility supports student use as well as outcomes.</p>
                    <h3>PASS Overview and Nationwide Problems</h3>
                    <p>The PASS program grew over 400% in the past year. This growth was in response to the implementation of a new practice that was designed to solve a problem recognized in the literature and on our FCC campus. The general problem is low attendance for tutoring and SI sessions. According to the Center for Community College Engagement or the CCCSE (2012), the attendance rate for SI sessions was reported at 18% while the attendance rate for tutoring sessions was reported at 24%; this includes students who visited once or more, and the numbers are frighteningly low. The specific problem is that researchers do not agree about how to modify student behavior to increase attendanceâ€¦ and the ramifications of such threaten student success.</p>
                    <h3>The Effect at FCC</h3>
                    <p>PASS supports a diverse population of students including underrepresented, disproportionately impacted, and underprepared students. Our PASS students have specific needs and challenges that often interfere with success, which were further established by a survey. Last semester, PASS students revealed they were often hungry while in class or studying in PASS sessions; they also reported skipping PASS sessions due to hunger. Our students are hungry, and they need our support with this as much as they do with academics. While the PASS data on our homepage indicate the significant differences made by PASS (PASS students have significantly higher GPA and success outcomes at all levels between FA14 and SP15), we wanted to reach more students and their needs. However, the issue was that we needed to bring students to PASS in order to help with the college experience, and this is exactly what we did by offering brain food as a positive reinforcement instrument to modify behavior to increase attendance for PASS sessions.</p>
                    <h3>Solutions (brain food) and Spotlight</h3>
                    <p>In FA14, PASS revealed an attendance rate of 26%, proving congruency with the nationwide epidemic of low attendance for tutoring and SI sessions (CCCSE, 2012). While we were still 8% higher than the national average, we needed to reach more students. After the implementation of brain food, attendance increased from 26% in FA14 to 67% in SP15. This preliminary research garnered attention at conferences hosted by Texas A&M University and the Northern California Writing Centers Association (NCWCA). In May of 2015, I presented at Texas A&M University to share the preliminary research regarding the problem of low attendance and the treatment of brain food as positive reinforcement to modify student behavior for PASS attendance. The responses from various colleges and universities were overwhelmingly positive, and at least five universities decided to initiate the same practice on their campuses. The presentation was also attended by Kate Gold, Supplemental Instruction Business /Consulting Coordinator at UMKC (founding institution of SI), who commended the concept and application of brain food. In addition, it is my hope to bring Ms. Gold to FCC for PASS faculty and tutor training in the near future. In SP16, I hope to conduct a true experiment for my dissertation research here at Fresno City College.</p>
                    <h3>Growth</h3>
                    <p>While PASS has existed in some capacity for a few years, it was difficult to test for significance due to small samples in the past. The new PASS began to collect data and modify practices in FA14. The program began with 12 sections in FA14, 25 sections in SP15, 31 sections in SU15, and over 50 registered sections for FA15. The program will serve over 1500 students in the new semester that represent all levels of English and EMLS courses from developmental to transfer levels (now serving literature as well). While we look forward to quantifying the PASS
                    experience from this summer, what we currently know is that in the first week of the SU15 six-week session, PASS showed an unduplicated headcount of 443 students (this is over half of the total number of enrolled students) with over 1200 visits. Due to the vision of Dr. Villa (VP of Student Services) and many others including Leticia Canales (Transfer Center Coordinator, Camino), this summer, PASS collaborated with the inaugural Summer Bridge program, which has proven a success so far. The Summer Bridge program and Student Equity have been providing snacks for the students while in tutoring sessions, which is in direct support of PASS and our brain food practices. In addition, PASS has been the only student supportive service available to students between 4:30pm and 7:00pm, Monday through Thursday. Our PASS students have taken full advantage of the services in the evening hours with tutors and printing services though we do not turn away any student. In the first 2 weeks, PASS served over 100 students in the PASS Center during the evening hours (thank you to Don Lopez for allowing us to remain in the building this late). We have also embraced online tutoring using the OEI selected Link Systems World-Wide-White-Board and Net Tutor options, which provide 24/7 synchronous online tutoring using our PASS tutors and Net tutors.</p>
                    <h3>Closing Words (and a call for more space)</h3>
                    <p>PASS certainly takes a step outside the box in order to reach students, and our efforts have proven successful thus far! With over 1500 students connected to PASS, we have certainly outgrown the single classroom we currently use as the PASS Center. We hope to enjoy the use of a second established location for FA15 in order to provide consistent support to our students. Our significant data have been stable, and we believe a second established location will support continued student success, which is our very reason for existing.
