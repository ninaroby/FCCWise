Dear,

I was very sorry to hear that a student was unhappy with my efforts to help them.  I consider myself a conscientious and dedicated PASS leader and always strive to help people to the best of my ability. I remember the incident in question very well; I spent about 45 minutes attempting to help a student and I was having technical difficulties with the microphone.  In retrospect, I should have reported the issue and I apologize for neglecting to log the session properly but, as I am sure you are aware, I am new to the PASS program and have had a lot to learn this summer.  However, I most certainly never intended to be dismissive of a student in need of help and I am deeply sorry if I gave that impression. During my short time with PASS, I have had a lot of positive feedback from my students, I get a great deal of satisfaction from helping people and I am always striving to be better.
