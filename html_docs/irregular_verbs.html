<h2>Irregular Verbs</h2>
<p>In English, regular verbs consist of three main parts: the root form (present), the (simple) past, and the past
participle. <b>Regular verbs</b> have an -ed ending added to the root verb for both the simple past and past participle.
<b>Irregular verbs</b> do not follow this pattern, and instead take on an alternative pattern.</p>
<p>The following is a partial list of irregular verbs found in English. Each listing consists of the present/root form
of the verb, the (simple) past form of the verb, and the past participle form of the verb.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> Know, knew, known</p>
<p><b>Present:</b> I know how to write music.
</p><p><b>Past:</b> I knew how to write music when I was younger.</p>
<p><b>Past
Participle:</b> I have known how to write music.</p>
