<h2><u>“Can you help me with quoting?”</u></h2>

<h3>Use quotation marks to enclose direct quotations:</h3>

	<ul>
	<li> Direct quotations of a person’s spoken words, whether spoken or written, must be in 
	quotation marks. 
	</ul>

<p>“The contract negotiations are stalled,” the airline executive 
 told reporters, “but I am prepared to work night and day to 
 bring both sides together.” </p>

	<ul>
	<li> In dialogue, begin a new paragraph to mark a change in speaker. 
	</ul>

<p>“Hey Adrian,” said Sara. “What are you doing later?” She began 
to twirl her hair absentmindedly while simultaneously eating 
chow mein. </p>

<p>“Oh nothing. Just being cool,” he replied, as he strode in on 
 his scooter. He had never looked so manly. </p>

<p>Amy interjected, “Hey! You’re not cool!” She stood up, placing 
 her fists on her hips, lip pouted out.</p> 

	<ul>
	<li> If a single speaker utters more than one paragraph, introduce each paragraph with a 
	quotation mark, but do not use a closing quotation mark until the end of the speech. 
	</ul>

<p>“So then the other day, I was walking around and I realized 
  that my shoe lace was untied. I was in such a big hurry that I 
  stumbled upon my own laces. It was a disgrace!”</p> 

<p>“Luckily, an angel fell from the heavens. The most beautiful, 
the most wonderful woman I had seen in my entire life… walked 
right past me. However, some dude walking behind her helped me 
out.” </p>

<h3>Introducing Quoted Material:</h3>

	<ul>
	<li> A formal introduction is a full independent clause, not just an expression such as he 
	said or she remarked. 
	</ul>

<p>Thomas Friedman provides a challenging yet optimistic view of 
 the future: “We need to get back to work on our country… the 
 payoff couldn’t be greater” (25).</p> 
 
 
	<ul> 
	<li> If a quotation is introduced with an expression such as he said or she remarked- or if it 
	is followed by such an expression- a comma is needed. 
	</ul>

<p>About New England’s weather, Mark Twain once declared, “In the 
 spring I have counted one hundred and thirty-six different kinds 
 of weather within four and twenty hours” (55).</p> 

	<ul>
	<li> When a quotation is blended into the writer’s own sentence, either a comma or no 
	punctuation is appropriate, depending on the way in which the quotation fits into the 
	sentence structure.
	</ul> 

<p>The future champion could, as he put it, “float like a 
 butterfly and sting like a bee” (4).</p> 

	<ul>
	<li> If a quotation appears at the beginning of a sentence, use a comma after it unless the 
	quotation ends with a question mark or an exclamation point. 
	</ul>

<p>“I’ve always thought of myself as a reporter,” claimed 
 American poet Gwendolyn Brooks (162).</p> 

	<ul>
	</li> If a quoted sentence is interrupted by explanatory words, use commas to set off the 
	explanatory words. 
	</ul>

<p>“With regards to air travel,” Stephen Ambrose notes, 
 “Jefferson was a full century ahead of the curve” (53).</p> 

	<ul>
	<li> If two successive quotes sentences from the same source are interrupted by explanatory 
	words, use a comma before the explanatory words and a period after them. 
	</ul>

<p>“Everyone agrees journalists must tell the truth,” Bill Kovach 
 and Tom Rosenstiel write. “Yet people are befuddled about what 
 ‘the truth’ means” (37).</p> 

<h3>Air Quotes: </h3>

	<ul>
	<li> Do not use quotes for emphasis on a certain word or phrase. It may not come across 
	the way that you intended. 
	</ul>

<p>He thought he was “special” as he rode in on his bright red 
 scooter, declaring his awesomeness to all who were near. What a 
 great “friend” he was, leaving all his friends behind in the 
 dust of his electricity powered wheels.</p>
