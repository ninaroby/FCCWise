<h1>Quick Guide - Grammar Terms</h1>
<h3>Articles</h3>
	<blockquote><ul><li> <b>Indefinite</b>: a/an/some</li>
		<b>Examples</b>: I ate an apple. I ate a banana. I ate some apples<br>
		<p>The above sentences are not referring to a specific apple or banana. Since both nouns are
				indefinite singular countable nouns, it is necessary to put an article before the noun. The
				indefinite article some refers to non-specific plural nouns.</p>
		Use a before consonant sounds. Use an before vowel sounds.<br><br>
		<ul><li> <b>Definite</b>: the</li>
		<b>Example</b>: I went to eat the apple, but it was gone.
		The above sentence refers to a specific apple. The reader would have prior knowledge
		about this specific apple.</blockquote>
<h3><u>Qualifiers and Quantifiers</u></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Qualifier</b>: Words or phrases that add meaning to a noun, noun phrase, verb, or verb
phrase.
<br><b>Examples</b>: good, generally, somewhat, very, kind of, enough…<br>
<li><b>Quantifiers</b>: Words or phrases that show quantity of a noun.</li>
</ul>
<b>Examples</b>: three, each, some, every, that, all of the, many, a few …
FYI1
: It is important to look at the relationship between countable and uncountable nouns.
<h3>Clauses</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Subordinate Clause</b>: Also known as a dependent clause. Subordinate clauses have a
subject and a verb, but they are not complete sentences. Look for subordinating
conjunctions (see below) at the beginning of the clause.</p>
<b>Example:</b> While I was at the Writing and Reading Center, I got help with my
paper.
<br><b>FYI:</b> The underlined subordinate clause needs a comma and another clause to make it a complete
sentence. Not all subordinate conjunctions can start a sentence.
<br><b>Example</b>: I got help with my paper while I was at the Writing and Reading
Center.
<br><b>FYI</b>: There is no comma needed if the clause is after an insubordinate clause.
<li> <b>Insubordinate Clause</b>: Also known as an independent clause or main clause.
Insubordinate clauses have at least one subject and verb.
Example: I got help with my paper.</li>

FYI – For your information

<h3>Phrases</h3>
<ul>
<li> Phrase: This is an incomplete sentence because it lacks a subject or a verb.
Example: An accomplished and well-respected cook. (This phrase contains a
subject, the cook, but no verb).
<h3>Conjunctions</h3>
<li> Coordinating conjunctions: These are more commonly known as FANBOYS. Use a
coordinating conjunction to join two independent clauses.
<br>Examples: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so
<br>FYI: A safe rule is to use a comma when joining two independent clauses with a coordinating
conjunction. There are some exceptions.
<br>- Do not use a comma when joining two nouns.
<br>- Do not use a comma when you are joining clauses that are not independent clauses.
<li> Subordinating conjunctions: Words that are used to link sentences. A subordinate
conjunction can go before or after the main clause (see Clauses).
Some Common Examples: until, while, since, when, because, after,
even though, so that, and before.</li></ul>
<h3>Common Error types</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Run-on sentence:</b> Two clauses that are connected with no punctuation mark or
conjunction.
<br><b>Example</b>: The boy was walking inside it was raining outside.
<li> <b>Comma splice:</b> Two clauses have been connected incorrectly with a comma.
<br><b>Example</b>: The boy was walking inside, it was raining outside.
<h3>Punctuation</h3>
<li> <b>Colon</b>: A colon is used to introduce a list. It draws attention to information that follows.</li>
<br><b>Example</b>: I need the following items: rolls, sandwich meat, and cheese.

<ul>
<li> <b>Comma</b>: A comma is used to separate words or ideas.
<br><b>Example</b>: I am going to bring rolls, sandwich meat, and cheese.
<li> Ellipsis: An ellipsis is used to show omitted words or sentences or to indicate a pause in
dialogue.
<br><b>Example</b>: He said, “I want to go to many places in the world such as Paris,
Seoul, Beijing, and Ankara.”
 He said, “I want to go to…Paris, Seoul, Beijing, and Ankara.”
<li> <b>Semicolon</b>: A semicolon is used to connect independent clauses and to indicate a closer
relationship between the clauses than a period does.
<br><b>Example</b>: I am going to the grocery store; I need to buy cookies and milk.
<h3>Common Types of Sentences</h3>
<li> <b>Simple</b>: One clause with at least a subject and a verb.
<br><b>Example</b>: I ran outside.
<li> <b>Compound</b>: Two clauses joined together with a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS)
or semicolon.
<br><b>Example</b>: I ran outside, but my brother stayed inside.
 I ran outside; my brother stayed inside.
<li> <b>Complex</b>: Two clauses joined together by a subordinating conjunction.
<br><b>Examples</b>:
<li> I am really happy because I got an A on my test.
<li> Because I got an A on my test, I am really happy.
<li> <b>Complex-compound</b>: Two independent clauses with one or more dependent clauses.
<br><b>Examples</b>:
<li> Because my wife got a promotion, we are going to pay off our
house, and we will buy a new car.</li>
<h3>Homonyms</h3>
<b>Homonyms</b> are words that have the same spelling and same pronunciation, but they have
different meanings.
<br> <b>Example</b>: I am going to watch the game. I bought a new watch.
<h3>Homophones</h3>
<b>Homophones</b> are words that have the same pronunciation, but different spelling and meanings
<br> <b>Example</b>: Their binoculars are very powerful. Look over there.
their/there; two, to, too; passed, past; bored, board
FYI. Many writers have trouble with homophones. These words are commonly confused words.
