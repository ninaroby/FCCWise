<h1><u>Compare and Contrast Essay</u></h1>

<p><b>Pre-Write:</b> Two options to brainstorm your paper are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li> Venn Diagram: Allows you to visually compare and contrast topics. The differences go
on the outside circles and the similarities in the overlapped section.

<li> Listing: Write out your ideas versus mapping them out.
 Similarities Differences

<h3>Introduction:</h3>

<p>Like any paper, you need to introduce what you are going to be talking about. Briefly describe
the topics without comparing and contrasting yet. You can also use an allegory or story to
introduce your topics. See the Introductions handout for more information.</p>

<p>	<ul>
	<li> Thesis Statement:
<br>Like any other assignment, you need to have a thesis statement in your paper. The
purpose is to inform, not to persuade, so your opinion is not going to be the focus. Some
instructors may have you choose which topic you like better. That should be left for the
conclusion. The basic structure of a thesis for a compare/contrast paper follows:
Topic 1 and Topic 2 are similar in ________________ but are different in ___________.
<br><br>Example: <i>Cats and dogs are similar in that they both have fur and tails but are different in size
and personality.</i><br>
Thesis statements do not have to be exactly like the example. Just make sure to mention
what you are comparing and contrasting and in what areas.
<br><br>Body: There are two ways to organize your body paragraphs:
<br><br><li> Point by point: Explain how the two topics are similar or different on a specific point.
For example, you may talk about how cats and dogs are both animals, but in the next
paragraph you would talk about how they differ in characteristics.
<li> Block: Talk about one topic completely before talking about the other. Perhaps there will
be a paragraph on just their similarities.
Conclusion: Like any other conclusion, summarize your main points. If you can, make a world
connection and be sure to include your final thoughts on your topics. This would be the place to
choose which topic you like better if thatâ€™s what your instructor wants.</p>
