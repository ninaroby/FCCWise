<h1>Essay Writing Step by Step</h1>
<p>“Write an essay? But I don’t know how!” If you are unnerved by the thought of
writing a college essay, remember that this task can be accomplished in the same
way as any other—one step at a time. An effective essay is the result of careful
thinking, planning, writing, and revising. If you work hard on the first two steps, the
last two will be much easier. Your goal is to produce an essay whose content is
focused, well-developed, and clear.</p>

<h3>THINKING</h3> (Many decisions must be made before you actually write anything down.)

<h2>1. Consider purpose:</h2> <p>The general purpose of your essay will usually be determined by your
instructor. To be sure you know the specific purpose of your particular essay, complete this
sentence: “The purpose of my essay is to ….”</p>
Example:
<p><b>General Purpose:</b> Describe in detail an important characteristic of a person you know well.
</p><p><b>Specific Purpose:</b> The purpose of my essay is to describe my mother’s kindness toward her
family, friends, and co-workers.</p>

<h2>2. Consider audience:</h2> <p>The identity of your audience will determine how much background
information will be necessary and what terms need to be used or defined. For example, an essay
written for nurses on care of the elderly will include less background and more technical
information than an essay written for the general public on the same topic. Unless directed
otherwise, you should write for an uninformed audience. Even if your instructor is your audience,
you still need to write as if he or she has little familiarity with your topic because your instructor
wants to know the depth of your understanding.</p>

<h2>3. Consider tone:</h2> <p>The tone of your writing reveals your attitude toward your subject. Definition
essays are usually written in an objective tone, but a humorous tone may be appropriate for a
personal narrative.</p>

<h2>4. Select and narrow a topic:</h2><p> Your topic should have significance for the reader and should be
specific enough for you to adequately discuss in the required number of words or pages. If
research is necessary, you may find it easier to first gather material on your general topic and
then narrow your topic. (These two steps may need to be repeated more than once as you work
on your paper.) For example, if you need to write a five-page essay on the effects of air
pollution, you would severely limit the scope of your paper. The following example shows how
to narrow your topic until the focus is specific enough for a five-page paper:</p>
<p>The effects of air pollution (most general)
The effects of air pollution on children’s health
The effects of air pollution on respiratory diseases in urban children
The effects of air pollution on the prevalence and severity of childhood asthma in urban
areas (most specific)</p>

<h2>5. Choose a writing strategy:</h2> <p>To communicate ideas to readers, writers employ many types of
strategies, such as description, narration, comparison/contrast, definition, classification,
argument/persuasion, analysis, and evaluation. The strategy (or “method” or “mode”) you choose
for a particular assignment will be partly determined by the purpose of your assignment and the
expectations of the instructor. Using primarily one strategy may be appropriate for one
assignment, while using several strategies may strengthen the effectiveness of another essay.</p>

<h3>PLANNING</h3> <p>(Write down a plan to guide you when you write your first draft.)</p>

<h2>1. Create a tentative thesis:</h2> <p>Write out the main point you want to make about your topic in a
complete sentence. This sentence is called a <i>thesis</i>; it should be a <i>mini-summary</i> of your whole
essay. Everything else that you write will be related to this idea. If you are able to at this point,
write out your possible sub-points in sentences, also. Sub-points are the ideas you present to
support (“prove”) your thesis. In an argument essay the sub-points would be the reasons for your
claim. The sub-points of a compare/contrast essay would be the similarities and differences
between two or more subjects. You might not use these sentences word-for-word in your essay,
but by writing out your ideas in this way you ensure that your thinking about your topic is crystal
clear, which will assist you in remaining focused on your topic. <i>Note</i>: If your thesis must be
supported by research, you need to read widely and take notes by whatever method you prefer
before writing your tentative thesis. Be sure to include all necessary citation information in your
notes.</p>

<h2>2. Write down supporting content in a loosely-organized way:</h2> <p>In order to logically relate
your own ideas or contents of your notes, create a list, chart, cluster, or whatever plan you prefer,
as long as it is appropriate for your assignment. At this point you may find that you need to
refocus your thesis, add or remove sub points, and /or obtain more information.</p>

<h2>3. Create a detailed outline or other organizational plan:</h2>
<p>Study your planning activity in #2 above to determine a logical order for presenting your
material. Some common methods are least important to most important, simple to complex, and
problem to solution. Your writing strategy will influence your sequencing decisions. For
example, your reasoning regarding sequence will be different for a narrative essay than for an
argument essay. In all cases your sequence should be logical and should strengthen the
effectiveness of your essay.</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Write your outline, basing it on the content of your planning activity.</li>
	<li>Examine your outline for weaknesses in logic or development.</li>
	<li>You may want to outline the content of your introduction and conclusion at this point,
	although some writers prefer to do this after writing the body of the paper.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>WRITING</h3> <p>(Now it’s finally time to write your essay!)</p>

<h2>1. Write your first draft:</h2> Your essay will include an introduction, the body, and a conclusion.
 <h3>A. Introduction:</h3> The introduction should engage your reader and fully prepare him or her
for the rest of your essay. Its focus often moves from general to specific.
 Capture the reader’s attention in your opening sentences by using such techniques as a
question, quotation, general truth, startling statement, dramatic illustration, or an anecdote.
 Provide background information such as definitions, historical context, character—any
information which the reader needs to clearly understand your essay.
 Convince the reader that your topic has significance. If the relevance and importance of
your topic are clear, the reader will be motivated to read your essay.
 Write a strong thesis, usually at or near the end of your introduction. Remember, the
thesis is the core of your essay, stating your main point and often including a forecast of
your sub points in the same order in which you will present them. The thesis acts like a
“road map” of your paper, letting your reader know the scope and limitations of your
essay (what it will cover, what it won’t cover) and how it is organized. The thesis should
reflect your position or perspective, rather than simply stating a fact. It should also
confirm the relevance and significance of your topic. Some instructors call this the “so
what?” of your thesis. In the sample thesis below, the words “drastic increase” establish
the significance of the thesis. 
Sample thesis:
“During the last ten years, air pollution in large cities has caused a drastic increase in the number
of children who develop asthma and in the severity of their symptoms.”
Note: Do not announce” your thesis with phrases such as “I am going to discuss” or
 “This essay is about.”

<h3>B. Body of Essay:</h3> The body of your essay includes all the paragraphs that support (or
“prove”) your thesis and sub-points.
• Write strong topic sentences: Each paragraph has a topic sentence that expresses one
of your sub-points in a general way. This sentence usually comes at the beginning of the
paragraph. In a shorter essay you would probably devote only one paragraph to each subpoint.
In a longer, more in-depth essay, several paragraphs might be needed to adequately
develop support for your sub-point; however, each paragraph should still have its own
topic sentence relating the paragraph to the sub-point.
• Present supporting details carefully: Just as the topic sentences need to fully support
the thesis of your essay, the details (or “evidence”) need to fully support each topic
sentence. These details should be effective in content, specific in focus, and adequate in
amount. Furthermore, they should be expressed in concrete rather than general language.
• Use transitions to establish logical connections: Transitions are words or groups of
words that connect ideas in a logical way. They are like road signs that help the reader
understand how the information to follow is related to what has already been said.
Transitional words and phrases may be used within sentences to show many logical
relationships, such as:
contrast “on the other hand”
summary “in conclusion”
time “later”
order “second”
example “for instance”
In most cases, one or more transitional sentences are needed between paragraphs to link
sub topics together or to the thesis.

<h3>C. Conclusion:</h3> The conclusion, like the introduction, should be more general than the body
of your essay. It should not introduce new ideas. Your own “voice” should be strong.
• Reemphasize the main point of your essay by restating the thesis and support points.
• Remind the reader of the significance of your topic.
• If appropriate, include “forecast” statements concerning the future, a call for action, or
other challenge to the reader.
• If you have used an anecdote or image in your introduction, returning to it in the
conclusion can strengthen the unity of your essay.
• End with a strong sentence that has a satisfying “concluding sound,” letting the reader
know that you are finished.

<b>REVISING</b> (Don’t skimp on time and effort here if your goal is a quality essay.)
<h3>1. Revise important writing issues</h3> such as focus, thesis, organization, development, and
coherence (clearness of your meaning). Strengthen your introduction and conclusion so that they
will have the greatest impact on the reader. Examine your essay again to see if these steps need
to be repeated.

<h3>2. Edit for errors</h3> in punctuation, grammar, spelling, capitalization, and format style
(MLA,APA, Chicago, or other).

<h3>3. Document sources, if required</h3>, within the text and on a works cited page, using the
appropriate style format.
<b>NOW REWARD YOURSELF FOR A JOB WELL-DONE!</b> 

<h2>The Writing Process</h2>

<h3>Invention: Getting Ideas</h3>
Brainstorm.
Free write.
Make a cluster map of your ideas.
Make a chart (rows and columns) for your ideas.
Ask questions: Who? What? Where? When? How? Why?
Write and exploratory draft (also called a discovery draft).

<h3>Finding a Purpose and Organizing Ideas</H3>
 Look for a main idea.
 Write a working thesis statement.
 Gather/group supporting material for the thesis. Cut extraneous points. Add material where
needed.
 Plan body paragraphs.
 Create a rough outline, map, or chart.

<h3>Writing the First Draft</h3>
 Start where you feel most confident.
 Use your working thesis as a reference point.
 Suspend judgment on what you are trying to write.
 Don’t look back: look ahead.
 Keep the momentum going.
 When the draft is done, let it sit. Take a break.

<h3>Revising the Rough Draft(s)</h3>
 Read your writing.
 Revise for unity (focus) in the whole.
 Add ideas/information that does not help the thesis
 Delete ideas/information that does not help the thesis.
 Revise for coherence among the parts.
 Use a post-draft outline to evaluate your organization.
 Are you telling readers everything they need to know?
 Are you showing how one idea leads to the next?
 Be prepared to write several revisions: good things take time.

<h3>Editing</h3>
 Read your writing again.
 Check for effective and correct sentences.
 Check for concise and concrete use of language.
 Use a dictionary to check uncertain word meanings.
 Check conventions for the manuscript format you are following.

<h3>Proofreading</h3>
 Read your writing again.
 Ask someone else to red your writing (but don’t expect someone else to fix your problems).
 Check spelling.
 Check punctuation.
 Check for obvious errors
