<h1>Sentence Structures</h1>
<p>There are many types of sentence structures. Some of the more common ones are the simple
sentence, the compound sentence, and the complex sentence.</p>
<h3>The Simple Sentence</h3>
<p>A <b>simple sentence</b> has only one subject-verb combination and expresses a complete thought.</p>
An owl hooted.
<p>As simple sentence may have more than one subject.</p>
<p>Lemons and limes taste sharp and tangy.</p>
<p>A simple sentence may have more than one verb.</p>
<p>The puppies nipped and nuzzled one another playfully.</p>
<p>A simple sentence may even have several subjects and verbs:</p>
<p>Every New Year’s Eve my parents, aunts, and uncles eat, dance, and welcome the New
Year together.</p>

<h3>The Compound Sentence</h3>
<p>A <b>compound sentence</b> is made up of two or more complete thoughts. For instance, look at the
following simple sentences:</p>
<p>Supper is ready.</p>
<p>The guests have not arrived.</p>
<p>These two simple sentences can be combined to form one compound sentence:</p>
<p>Supper is ready, but the guests have not arrived.</p>
<p>The process of joining two ideas of equal importance is known as <b>coordination</b>. <i>Put a comma
plus an adjoining word</i> (<b>coordinating conjunction</b>, sometimes referred to as FANBOYS).</p>

<b>F</b>or
<br><b>A</b>nd
<br><b>N</b>or
<br><b>B</b>ut
<br><b>O</b>r
<br><b>Y</b>et
<br><b>S</b>o

<h3>The Complex Sentence</h3>
<p>A <b>complex sentence</b> includes one independent statement and at least one <i>dependent statement</i>,
which cannot stand alone.</p>
<blockquote><i>If it thunders</i>, our dog hides under the bed.</blockquote>
<p><i>Our dog hides under the bed</i> is a complete sentence; it can stand alone.</p>
<p><i>If it thunders</i> is dependent, and cannot stand alone. This is also called a fragment.</p>

<h3>The Sentence Fragment</h3>
<p>A <b>fragment</b> is a <b>phrase</b> or <b>dependent clause</b>. It is an incomplete sentence because it lacks a
subject or a verb (which makes it a phrase) or does not express a complete thought (as in a
depending clause).</p>
<p><b>Phrase:</b> An accomplished and well-respected cook. (This phrase contains a subject, the
cook, but no verb).</p>
<p><b>Clauses</b> are different from phrases because clauses contain both a subject and a verb. A
<b>dependent clause</b> is an <b>independent clause</b> that contains a <b>subordinating conjunction.</b> For
<i>more examples of subordinating conjunctions, see handout “Useful Ways to Join Ideas.”</i></p>
<p><b>Dependent
 Clause:</b> While I eat.</p>

<h3>The Run-On Sentence</h3>
<p>There are two types of run-ons: <b>fused sentences</b> and <b>comma splices.</b></p>
<p>When there is no punctuation at all separating two complete statements, it is a <b>fused sentence.</b></p>
<p>Computer skills are useful in college they will help you in the job market as well.</p>
<p>When a comma alone separates two complete thoughts, the result is called a <b>comma splice.</b></p>
<p>Computer skills are useful in college, they will help you in the job market as well.</p>
<p>Here are some common ways to fix fused sentences and comma splices:</p>
	<ol>
	<li> Use a period. Form two independent sentences.
	<li> Use a semicolon; separate the clauses.
	<li> Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction, and connect the two ideas.
	<li> If one idea is of greater importance, express the lesser idea as a dependent clause.</li>
