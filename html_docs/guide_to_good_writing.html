<h1>A Guide for Good Writing</h1>
<p>The following are some basic tips that will help guide you in your future writing endeavors.</p>
<p>Remember the Writing Process:</p>

	<ul>
	<li><i>Prewriting</i> – Brainstorm and plan the ideas of the paper</li>
	<li><i>Drafting</i> - Get the ideas down on paper and create a first draft</li>
	<li><i>Revising</i> - Share the draft, add details, and revise sentences, weak words and structure</li>
	<li><i>Proofreading</i> – Correct spelling and mechanical errors</li>
	<li><i>Publishing</i> – Create a final copy of the paper, create a title, and share with others</li>
	</ul>

<p>When beginning an essay or other writing assignment, be sure to restate the prompt in your introductory
paragraph and then include the main ideas or rationale that you wish to discuss in your paper. Each of
those ideas will become the body paragraphs.</p>
<p>Be sure to completely answer all parts of the prompt and follow the teacher’s directions for the
assignment exactly. Ask questions and seek help if you get confused!</p>
<p>Make sure the opening sentences of your essay is creative, interesting and draws the reader into your
paper.</p>
<p>Hamburger Paragraph (or essay) format:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Topic Sentence</i> – Tells the reader what the paragraph will be about; the main idea.</li>
<li><i>Supporting Sentence</i> – Provides support to main idea of the paragraph.</li>
<li><i>Supporting Sentence</i> - Provides support to main idea of the paragraph.</li>
<li><i>Supporting Sentence</i> - Provides support to main idea of the paragraph.</li>
<li><i>Concluding Sentence</i> – Sums up main idea of paragraph.</li>
</ul>

<p>This paragraph format can be expanded to become the structure for an essay, research project, or any
other written document. When this format is used in an essay, the topic sentence, supporting
sentences, and concluding sentence all become paragraphs, but they are still used in the same order.</p>
<p>Consider your audience and write as though they so not know as much as you do about your subject.</p>
<p>Expand your writing using descriptive words and lots of detail!</p>
<p>Make your writing interesting by using adjectives and adverbs (refer to a thesaurus!)</p>
<p>The conclusion of your essay is very similar to the introduction: it should restate the prompt, readdress
your main idea, and restate your rationale. </p>
