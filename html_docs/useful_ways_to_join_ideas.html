<h2><u>Useful Ways to Join Ideas</u></h2> 
 
	<ul>
	<li> <b><u>Coordinating conjunctions:</u></b> A coordinating conjunction is used to join <b>two</b> 
	independent clauses. The seven most common coordinating conjunctions are for, and, 
	nor, but, or, yet, and so, which are typically referred to as FANBOYS.<br><br>
		<ul>
		<li> <b><u>Independent clauses</u></b> have at least one subject and verb. Independent clauses are 
		also known as insubordinate clauses.<br>
 
 			<blockquote><b>Independent clause:</b> I wanted help brainstorming ideas for an essay.<br> 
 			 			<b>Independent clause:</b> A tutor helped me outline my ideas.</blockquote>
 
		<li> Independent clauses can stand as a sentence on their own. However, it is 
		also possible to combine these two independent clauses into one sentence 
		using a comma and coordinating conjunction.</ul><br>
 
<b>Example:</b> I wanted to write my essay today, and a tutor helped me outline my ideas. <br><br>

<ul>
<li> <b><u>Subordinating conjunctions:</u></b> Words that are used to link ideas. A subordinate 
conjunction can go before or after the main clause and forms a dependent clause. <br><br>

<ul>
<li> <b><u>Dependent clauses</u></b> (also known as subordinate clauses) have a subject and a verb 
like an independent clause, but they are not complete sentences. Dependent 
clauses always begin with subordinating conjunctions (such as until, while, since, 
when, and because). In the following examples, the dependent clauses are 
underlined.</ul><br><br>
 
<b>Example:</b> <u>While I was at the Writing and Reading Center</u>, I got help with my paper. 
 
<blockquote>Note: The underlined dependent (subordinate) clause needs a comma and another clause to make 
 it a complete sentence. Not all subordinate conjunctions can start a sentence.</blockquote> 
 
<b>Example:</b> I got help with my paper <u>while I was at the Writing and Reading Center.</u> 
 
<blockquote>Note: There is no comma needed if the clause is after an independent (insubordinate) clause. </blockquote>
