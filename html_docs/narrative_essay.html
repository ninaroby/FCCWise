<h1>Narrative Essays</h1>

<h3>Before writing:</h3>
<section>Your instructor is going to give you a purpose for your narrative writing. Your job is to remember
a specific person/event/happening that applies to whatever prompt your instructor gives you.
Whatever that may be, you WILL need descriptive writing.</section>
<br><br><section>Descriptive writing is where you bring your reader into the story. The general rule here is show,
not tell. It may be easy to say that “It was a beautiful day.” That tells us about the day, but it
doesn’t show us. Show us it was a beautiful day: “The sun was shining brightly in the sky as the
clouds drifted aimlessly. A slight breeze touched my face, cooling down the effects of the sun.”
This shows us through different senses.</section>
<br><br><section>When you’re dealing with descriptive writing, go through the five senses: What did you feel,
hear, see, taste, and smell? Take time to go through every detail. You can weed through what
you don’t need to include later.</section>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<br><section>Different instructors will expect different things for your introduction. Some may ask you start
off at a specific moment; others may ask you to give a brief background on the point of your
narrative. For example, if you were supposed to write about a time when you weren’t honest, you
may begin by introducing honesty in general.</section>

<h3>Thesis statement:</h3>
<br><section>Your paper will still need a thesis statement. This is where you show how your personal
experience is related to the purpose of your paper.</section>
<br><blockquote>Ex. The instant I was caught in my web of lies was the moment I realized that I needed to
change the way I lived my life.</blockquote>

<h3>Body:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li> This is where you begin to tell your story. One of the ways to organize is just to go as it
	happened.
	<li> Another way is to set the scene. Where did this event occur? What was the weather like?
	<li> For this essay, it is okay to write in first person because this is a narrative about you.
	<li> Avoid using clichés like, “It was raining cats and dogs,” or “He was as strong as an ox.” Try to
	make up your own figurative language. Play around with metaphors, similes, and personification
	to make your narrative shine.</ul>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<br><p><section>And finally, your paper needs a conclusion. What was the significance of this event or place?
What was the final conclusion you can make based on this narrative? Summing up what
happened may also work, but you should try and focus more on the bigger picture on what this
event taught you.</section></p>

<h3>Time to Practice:</h3>
<p>To be a pro at descriptive writing, you need to practice. Here are some topics you can use to
practice showing verses telling:</p>
	<ol>
	<li> Your dream house
	<li> Your first day at Fresno City College
	<li> A family member
	<li> The best gift you ever received
	<li> The best childhood memory
	<br></ol>
