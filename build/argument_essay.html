<h1>Argumentative Essay</h1>

<h2>The Fresno City College Writing & Reading Center</h2> 
 
<h3>Before writing:</h3> 

<ul>
    <li> Choose a topic that is controversial. There needs to be someone who disagrees with you 
    on the issue, so you shouldn’t choose a topic like child slavery. Not many people are 
    supportive of this issue.</li>
    <li> When you have a basic idea of what you want to look for, you should start to research. 
    Use the FCC databases to search for academic articles about your topic.</li> 
    <li> Based off what you know and what you have researched, develop claims to support your 
    thesis.</li> 
    <li> A helpful tip is to make what is called a data sheet. This is just a collection of all the 
    quotes you may want to use organized under the citation of the source it came from. This will help eliminate that citing issue the day before the paper is due when you aren’t sure 
    which information came from where. Some instructors have you do the same format on 
    notecards. Either way works.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="example"><p><b>Example:</b>
        Harding, John. &ldquo;Pigs Can Fly.&rdquo;<i>Fallacy.</i> Fallacy. 2 Mar. 2011. Web. 11 
        Dec. 2012. 
        <p>&ldquo;Opposed to popular belief, pigs have developed a new way to fly. They 
        are more agile than their predecessors of the winged variety.&rdquo;</p> 
        <p>&ldquo;Pigs can fly because their noses allow them to filter the air through their 
        bodies, making them lighter. They then can float through the air. .001% of 
        pigs can do this.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>

 
<h3>Thesis statement:</h3> 
    
<ul>
    <li> The argumentative thesis statement needs to be definitive, to the point, and without bias!</li>
    <li> Do NOT announce what you are going to be arguing.
    
    <ul>
    <li class="example">&ldquo;I will be writing about capital punishment.&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    <li> It should take a stand on whatever topic you are arguing and include at least three points you will be arguing.

    <ul>
    <li class="example">&ldquo;Capital punishment should be illegal because it is immoral, expensive, and does not deter crime.&rdquo;
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

 
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<ul> 
    <li> As always, begin with a hook, which is a statement that grabs your reader’s attention. 
    <li> Here is where you want to give a background of the issue at hand. What are the sides? 
    Why are people for the issue? Why are they against it? Your thesis statement is going to 
    tell us which side you will be arguing for. 
    <li> Do NOT begin arguing in your introduction. Save it for your body paragraphs. 
    <li> Your thesis statement should be included in your introduction. Depending on your 
    instructor, it usually is found as the last sentence but can vary in location.
</ul>
 
 
 
 
<h3>Body:</h3>
<ul>
    <li> There is a bit more freedom here. Depending on how you want to set up your argument, 
    you have two choices:
        <ul>
            <li> Point-counter, point-counter, point-counter. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Here You lay out your claims with the objections in each paragraph. You give 
    your point and what other people say against it.</li> 
                    <li> Make sure, when you use this method, you use clear transitions that tell 
    the reader who believes what.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul> 
        <ul>
            <li> Point, point, point, counter.
        <ul> 
            <li> Here you lay out your argument completely, and then, before the 
    conclusion, you mention the counter arguments.
            </li>
        </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    <li> Be sure to ask which method your instructor wants you to use. 
    <li> Either way, you need to refute or disprove the counter arguments. 
    <li> Give support to your claims using your resources. 
    <li> When you use your quotes, be sure to use the “sandwich method”: 
    <ul>
    <li> Introduce the quote (who said it?) 
    <li> Use the quote (what did it say?) 
    <li> Analyze the quote (what does it mean?)</ul>
    <ul> 
    <li> Some instructors may also allow you to write a paragraph with your personal opinion to 
    show where you may personally stand on the issue. Always refer to the prompt first and 
    ask your instructor on what they want. 
    <li> Tip: Organize your arguments from strongest to weakest. What you want to do is begin 
    strong and end strong. Take your first strongest paragraph and make it the last body 
    paragraph before your conclusion. Take your second strongest paragraph and make it 
    your first body paragraph. Your reader will remember the first and the last thing they 
    read. Stick your weakest arguments in the middle of the essay.
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li> Restate your thesis in different way. Do <em>NOT</em> just copy and paste your thesis into the conclusion. 
        <li> Restate your three best or main points that you argued. This will remind your reader of 
        your greatest arguments. 
        <li> Do NOT bring in new information. You want to end your paper here. Do NOT make it 
        seem like another body paragraph. 
        <li> Here you can also make a world connection, what the implications could be if your 
    argument is not paid attention to, and conclude with your final thoughts.
    </ul>
