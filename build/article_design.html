<h1>&ldquo;Can you help me with&nbsp;quoting?&rdquo;</h1>
<h2>The Fresno City College Writing & Reading Center</h2>

<h3>Use quotation marks to enclose direct quotations:</h3>

<section>
    <p><em>Direct quotations of a person’s spoken words, whether spoken or written, must be in quotation marks.</em></p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;The contract negotiations are stalled,&rdquo; the airline executive told reporters, &ldquo;but I am prepared to work night and day to bring both sides together.&rdquo; </p>
</section> 
 
<section>
    <p><em>In dialogue, begin a new paragraph to mark a change in speaker.</em></p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hey Adrian,&rdquo; said Sara. &ldquo;What are you doing later?&rdquo; She began to twirl her hair absentmindedly while simultaneously eating chow mein. </p>
</section>

<section>
    <p>&ldquo;Oh nothing. Just being cool,&rdquo; he replied, as he strode in on his scooter. He had never looked so manly. </p>
     
    <p>Amy interjected, &ldquo;Hey! You’re not cool!” She stood up, placing 
    her fists on her hips, lip pouted out.</p>
  </section> 

<section>
    <p><em>If a single speaker utters more than one paragraph, introduce each paragraph with a quotation mark, but do not use a closing quotation mark until the end of the speech.</em></p> 

    <p>&ldquo;So then the other day, I was walking around and I realized 
      that my shoe lace was untied. I was in such a big hurry that I 
      stumbled upon my own laces. It was a disgrace!</p> 

    <p>Luckily, an angel fell from the heavens. The most beautiful, 
    the most wonderful woman I had seen in my entire life… walked 
    right past me. However, some dude walking behind her helped me 
    out.&rdquo; </p>
</section>

<h3>Introducing Quoted Material:</h3>

<section>
    <p><em>A formal introduction is a full independent clause, not just an expression such as he said or she remarked.</em></p> 
     
    <p>Thomas Friedman provides a challenging yet optimistic view of 
    the future: &ldquo;We need to get back to work on our country… the 
    payoff couldn’t be greater&rdquo; (25).</p>
</section> 
 
<section>
    <p><em>If a quotation is introduced with an expression such as he said or she remarked- or if it is followed by such an expression- a comma is needed.</em></p> 

    <p>About New England’s weather, Mark Twain once declared, &ldquo;In the 
    spring I have counted one hundred and thirty-six different kinds 
    of weather within four and twenty hours&rdquo;(55).</p>
</section>   

<section>
    <p><em>When a quotation is blended into the writer’s own sentence, either a comma or no punctuation is appropriate, depending on the way in which the quotation fits into the sentence structure.</em></p>

    <p>The future champion could, as he put it, &ldquo;float like a 
    butterfly and sting like a bee&rdquo; (4).</p>
</section> 

<section>
    <p><em>If a quotation appears at the beginning of a sentence, use a comma after it unless the quotation ends with a question mark or an exclamation point.</em></p> 

    <p>&ldquo;I’ve always thought of myself as a reporter,&rdquo; claimed 
    American poet Gwendolyn Brooks (162).</p>
</section> 

<section>
    <p><em>If a quoted sentence is interrupted by explanatory words, use commas to set off the explanatory words.</em></p> 

    <p>&ldquo;With regards to air travel,&rdquo; Stephen Ambrose notes, 
    “Jefferson was a full century ahead of the curve” (53).</p>
</section> 

<section>
    <p><em>If two successive quotes sentences from the same source are interrupted by explanatory words, use a comma before the explanatory words and a period after them.</em></p> 
     
    <p>&ldquo;Everyone agrees journalists must tell the truth,&rdquo; Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel write. &ldquo;Yet people are befuddled about what ‘the truth’ means&rdquo; (37).</p>
</section> 

<h3>Air Quotes: </h3>

<section>
    <p><em>Do <em class="underline">not</em> use quotes for emphasis on a certain word or phrase. It may not come across the way that you intended.</em></p> 
     
    <p>He thought he was &ldquo;special&rdquo; as he rode in on his bright red scooter, declaring his awesomeness to all who were near. What a great &ldquo;friend&rdquo; he was, leaving all his friends behind in the dust of his electricity powered wheels.</p>
